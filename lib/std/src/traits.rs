/// Api are callbacks to system functions implemented outside of the wasm modules.
/// Currently it just supports address conversion but we could add eg. crypto functions here.
///
/// This is a trait to allow mocks in the test code. Its members have a read-only
/// reference to the Api instance to allow accessing configuration.
/// Implementations must not have mutable state, such that an instance can freely
/// be copied and shared between threads without affecting the behaviour.
/// Given an Api instance, all members should return the same value when called with the same
/// arguments. In particular this means the result must not depend in the state of the chain.
/// If you need to access chaim state, you probably want to use the Querier.
/// Side effects (such as logging) are allowed.
///
/// We can use feature flags to opt-in to non-essential methods
/// for backwards compatibility in systems that don't have them all.

    /// Performs a Tableland read query.

    /// Emits a debugging message that is handled depending on the environment (typically printed to console or ignored).
    /// Those messages are not persisted to chain.
